# ORACLE_PDB_ASSIGNMENT_II_THERESE_28521
### OVERVIEW
### THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON PRACTICAL EXERCISES WITH ORACLE DATABASE 21C. SPECIFICALLY ON PLUGGABLE DATABASE(PDBS).
## THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT ARE:
   1. CREATE A MAIN PLUGGABLE DATABASE(PDB) FOR REGULAR USE.
   2. CREATE AND DELETE A TEMPORARY PDB SAFELY WITHOUT AFFECTING THE MAIN PDB.
   3. USE ORACLE ENTERPRISE MANAGER(OEM)TO MONITOR THE DATABASE, CREATE USERS, AND MANAGE PRIVILEGES.
### ORACLE ENVIRONMENT USED
    . ORACLE DATABASE VERSION:21C DESKTOP CLASS
    . OPERATING SYSTEM: WINDOW 10
    . RAM: 4GB
    . TOOLS:SQL*PLUS VIA CMD,ORACLE ENTERPRISE MANAGER(OEM)
    . LISTENER:TCP LISTENER ON PORT 1539
    . CONTAINERS: CDB$ROOT,PDB$SEED, AND CUSTOM PDBS
### CREATE THE MAIN PLUGGABLE DATABASE
   OBJECTIVE: CREATE A MAIN PDB(TH_PDB_28521) TO SERVE AS THE PRIMARY WORKING CONTAINER.
   # STEPS AND EXPLAINATION
    . CONNECTED TO CDB$ROOT AS SYSDBA TO HAVE FULL ADMINISTRATIVE RIGHTS.
    . VERIFIED EXISTING PDBS BEFORE CREATION TO ENSURE ONLY PDB$SEED EXISTS.
    . CREATED THE MAIN PDB  BY COPYING SEED FILES
    . OPENED THE PDB IN READ WRITE MODE AND SAVE THE STATE TO ENSURE IT AUTOMATICALLY OPENS CORRECTLY
    . VERIFIED CREATION BY CHECKING THE LIST OF PDBs.
### CHALLENGE AND HAW THEY WERE SOLVED
   1. LISTENER WAS NOT AUTOMATICALLY CREATED BUT AFTER I HAVE CHECKED WELL AND I SAW THAT MANUALLY CREATED TCP LISTENER ON PORT 1539.
   2.  PDB OPENED READ ONLY BY DEFAULT FOR SOLVING THIS I USED ALTER PLUGGABLEDATABASE OPEN READ WRITE.
   3.  HOSTNAME MISMATCH IN LISTENER SO TO SOLVE IT  I USED LOCALHOST IN LISTENER.ORA.
### CREATING AND DELETING TEMPORARY PDB
    OBJECTIVE: CREATE A TEMPORARY PDB FOR PRACTICE, VERIFY IT, AND ALSO DELETE IT SAFELY.
  # STEPS AND EXPLAINATION
   . SWITCHED SESSION TO CDB$ROOT.
   . CREATING TEMPORARY PDB USING FULL PATHS FOR DATAFILES.
   . OPENED TEMPORARY PDB USING FULL PATHS FOR DETAILS
   . I VERIFIED THE TEMPORARY PDB IF EXISTS
   . CLOSED AND DROPPED THE TEMPORARY COMPLETELY.
   . VERFY IF IT WAS SUCCESSFULLY DELETED 
  # CHALLENGES AND SOLUTION
   . ERROR MISSING OR INVALID FILE NAME AND AFTER I PROVIDED FULL WINDOWS PATHS IN FILE_NAME_CONVERT.
   .TEMPORARY PDB OPENED READ ONLY FOR THIS CHALLENGE  I OPENED WITH READ WRITE AND SAVE STATE.
### ORACLE ENTERPRISE MANAGER (OEM)
   . OBJECTIVE: USE ORACLE ENTERPRISE MANAGER TO MONITOR THE DATABASE, MANAGE PDBs, AND CREATE USERS.
